Ethiopia is a region that has a long history,has some of the earliest human populations and possibly the region where 
people expanded and evolved out of Africa to populate the rest of the world 1.8 m years ago. The period begins with the 
Australopithecus, the ancient hominoids which extend to the early inhabitants of the pre-Aksumites. It is also the period 
with the arrival of Ge’ez and Judaism.
